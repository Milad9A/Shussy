            Hi, I'm Jeffrey. I'm the creator of Laracasts and spend most of my days building the site
            and thinking of new ways to teach confusing concepts. I live in Orlando, Florida with my
            wife and two kids. Before we can dive into writing the core logic, let's first set aside
            fifteen minutes or so
            to design the main timeline page, using Tailwind.
